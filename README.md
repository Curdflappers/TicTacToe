# TicTacToe
A Tic-Tac-Toe Java Swing Applet that lets the user play Tic-Tac-Toe with another player or an AI opponent.

**Features:**

GUI-based application!

Three difficulties of AI opponents!

Restart game functionality!

Status bar!

A **super annoying feature** where the circles are slightly off-centered (or maybe it's the line you'll never know)!
