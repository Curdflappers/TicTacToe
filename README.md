# TicTacToe
A Tic-Tac-Toe Java Swing Applet that lets the user play Tic-Tac-Toe with another player or an AI opponent.

**Features**
* GUI-based application!
* Three difficulties of AI opponents!
* Restart game functionality!
* Win line drawing!
* Status bar!
* A **super annoying feature** where the circles are slightly off-centered (or maybe it's the line you'll never know)!

## Setup

This project is currently only runnable in NetBeans. Clone the project and open it with NetBeans, then click start. When you click navigation buttons, you must resize the window for the new screen to appear (it's dumb, I know).
